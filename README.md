Hi and Welcome!

This is the GitHub repo for my Home insurance coverage and insurance sum calculator that can be found at [insurance.banyard.tech](https://insurance.banyard.tech).

## What is in each folder?

The Repo is split into multiple folders.

1. CODE
2. DOCS

Following each folder is explained and what you can find in it.

### CODE

This one is pretty straight forward. In the CODE folder you can find... the source code for the Web App.

How to run the App and what to do if you want to expand the Web App can be found in the README in the directory CODE.

### DOCS

This folder contains all the Documentation and any Images used in this file.
